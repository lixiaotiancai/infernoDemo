# React Fiber vs Stack Demo

This demo shows the differences between Stack and Fiber by rendering a Sierpinski triangle that constantly shrinks and grows, and whose nodes have a value that increments by one every second.

Used as a demo during the ReactJS Dublin Lightning Talks meetup of February 22nd 2017.
